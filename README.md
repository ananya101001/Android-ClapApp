Okay, here's a short description summarizing what we did to create the Clap App:

Objective: Build an Android app that simulates a "clap" by detecting when a hand moves close to the phone's front sensor.

Sensor Usage: We accessed the device's SensorManager and specifically registered a listener for the Sensor.TYPE_PROXIMITY.

Clap Detection Logic: Inside the onSensorChanged listener callback, we monitored the proximity sensor's value. A "clap" was registered only when the value transitioned from a "far" state (higher value) to a "near" state (typically 0.0 cm), preventing continuous triggers.

Feedback Implementation: Upon detecting the clap transition:

Played a pre-loaded sound effect using SoundPool for low latency.

Triggered a short vibration using Vibrator (required adding the VIBRATE permission to the AndroidManifest.xml).

Updated the Jetpack Compose UI by changing an Image resource, using MutableState for reactivity and a Coroutine (lifecycleScope.launch with delay) to revert the image after a short pause.

UI (Jetpack Compose): We built the user interface using Jetpack Compose, displaying status text, the live proximity value, and the visual feedback image, all driven by MutableState.

Lifecycle Management: We used a DisposableEffect composable along with a LifecycleObserver to correctly register the sensor listener when the app resumed and unregister it when paused, ensuring efficient resource usage.
